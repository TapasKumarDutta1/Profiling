# User Understanding via Knowledge Graphs


## 📌 Where to Start

### 1. Driver Notebook (Main Entry Point)
The primary notebook that runs the pipeline and produces the core outputs:

👉 **`profiling/person_pofiling.ipynb`**  
This notebook:
- Loads and preprocesses the raw interaction data  
- Constructs intermediate representations  
- Builds the knowledge graph    


### 2. Documentation & Reasoning
A detailed explanation of the approach, design decisions, trade-offs, and analysis:

👉 **`profiling/SIGNAL.pdf`**

The PDF includes:
- Motivation for using a knowledge graph representation  
- Discussion of high noise-to-signal ratio and how it is handled  
- Visualizations and interpretation of KG subgraphs  
- Limitations, failure modes, and scaling considerations
